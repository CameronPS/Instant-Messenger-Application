# Instant-Messenger-Application
An application built for an Introduction to Programming course, for an optional assignment of our own choosing. A video of it being demonstrated can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/ssy7xoHFuTY . 

To run launch the server and then launch as many clients as desired. The server IP address is required for connecting clients. 

Python launcher for Windows should be used to launch the scripts via Python 2, but launching the scripts with Python 2.7 installed should also work. The command line was used with no particular directory or arguments needed.

DISCLAIMER: I had learnt to program only 2 months before making this application.
